the app manager requires log in. admin credentials must be stored in a local instance-level file (instance/admin_config.json) or provided via environment variables during first-time setup. this file must not be git backed.

do not store passwords as plaintext (in repo or in config files). store only password hashes in instance/admin_config.json.

once logged in they see a nicely formated list of currenty set up apps, each row has a ... at the end and one of the options is edit

when editing all the values can be changed and there is a save button that saves the new configurations

configurations need to be saved on server and must survive restarts and code deploy
configurations should not be git backed

in additon there is a plus button to add a new row, the rows are laid out in table spacing but not an acutal table 
each row has it's own nice container 

a row has the following attributes:
- app name ( the display name to show when selectign the app from the main page)
- app port (the internal port the app is being served on)
- app logo (opional a picture to upload to put in front of the name on the button)

another option on the ... menu is delete, this deletes the configuration

another option on the ... menu is test, this pings the internal port and confirms that the app is indeed listening

another option on the ... menu is restart, this restarts the app running on that port ( if this requires more config when creatign a new row do that and let me know)
